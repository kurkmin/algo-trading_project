# Algo-trading_project:
This is algo-trading project using Cybos Plus API from Daishin Securities. The trading strategy will be based on the idea of pair-trading that finds statistical arbitrage opportunities between two stocks (e.g. preferred stock and common stock).

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP):
Make it work! 

### Possible Extenstion: 
Create user-friendly app (e.g. React for front-end and Spring for back-end) to change its strategy when there is no arbitrage in market. 

#### Additional notes: 
Cybos Plus API uses win32com.client. According to Microsoft, Component Object Model (COM) refers to "a Platform-independent, distributed, object-oriented system for creating binary software components that can interact. COM is the foundation technology for Microsoftâ€™s OLE (compound documents) and ActiveX (Internet-enabled components) technologies. COM objects can be created with a variety of programming languages."
